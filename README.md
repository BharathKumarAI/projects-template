# Template

Templates are meant for flexibility. we can adjust or modify this template based on our project needs.

This template is created based on the cookiecutter

```python
# Installing cookiecutter
pip install cookiecutter

# Create a project based on the template
cookiecutter https://github.com/khuyentran1401/data-science-template
```

**Note:** Refer packaging details [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/)

## Set up the environment

1. Install [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
2. Set up the environment: (we can include this details in `init_setup.sh` and initiate shell script)

```bash
# Direct
make activate
make setup
```

```bash
# initiating through shell script

cd <script_folder>
sh init_setup.sh # include the direct steps in the script
```

## Install new packages

To install new PyPI packages, run:

```bash
poetry add <package-name>
```

## Run the entire pipeline

To run the entire pipeline, type:

```bash
dvc repo
```

## Version your data

Read [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/introduction-to-dvc-data-version-control-tool-for-machine-learning-projects-7cb49c229fe0) on how to use DVC to version your data.

Basically, you start with setting up a remote storage. The remote storage is where your data is stored. You can store your data on DagsHub, Google Drive, Amazon S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage, Aliyun OSS, SSH, HDFS, and HTTP.

```bash
dvc remote add -d remote <REMOTE-URL>
```

Commit the config file:

```bash
git commit .dvc/config -m "Configure remote storage"
```

Push the data to remote storage:

```bash
dvc push
```

Add and push all changes to Git:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m 'commit-message'
git push origin <branch>
```

# Auto-generate API documentation

To auto-generate API document for your project, run:

```bash
make docs
```
